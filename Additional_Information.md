## Additional Information

To run the scripts, you will need to have downloaded and unzipped the data file to `./data/raw/household_power_consumption.txt`

The scripts assume you have `readr` and `lubridate` packages installed.

Each script uses the same set of code to read in, format and subset the dataset. Normally I'd push this out to a function in an external script, but requirements for the project specify that the code should exist in each script.
